# Restaurant Page

This is a single-page website displaying a very fake restaurant that might look a bit like an actual restaurant.

Click [here](https://mattheweng1.github.io/project-restaurant-page/) to check out the deployed application.

## Features

- Switch between the Home, Menu, and Contact Us tabs with a single click, without even leaving the page.
- Checkout the parallax effect as you scroll down the Menu!
- Don't read too closely or the illusion of a legitimate restaurant website will break (also, most of the buttons don't actually do anything).

## Languages and Tools

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- npm
- Webpack

## Note

This project was built as part of my web development journey on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

The purpose of this project was to try to create a website where the entire DOM is generated by Javascript (in case you're wondering why the HTML file is practically empty).
